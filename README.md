## Project Description

This project explores different machine learning models and techniques to solve https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/child-mind-institute-problematic-internet-use competition . The main focus is on:
- Feature engineering
- Clustering using DBSCAN and t-SNE
- Regression models like LightGBM and XGBoost
- Ensemble learning for model optimization

## File Descriptions

- **`LGBM.ipynb`**: Implementation of LightGBM regression model with detailed feature engineering.
- **`xgboost.ipynb`**: Application of XGBoost with pure feature engineering to improve model accuracy.
- **`dbscan-clustering-t-sne.ipynb`**: Clustering analysis using DBSCAN and visualization with t-SNE. Includes preprocessing to handle missing values in the dataset.
- **`ensemble_final.ipynb`**: Combines multiple models for ensemble learning to boost performance.
- **`README.md`**: This documentation file

## Usage

1. Open the relevant notebook (e.g., `LGBM.ipynb`, `dbscan-clustering-t-sne.ipynb`).
2. Execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the results.
3. Modify the code as needed to experiment with different hyperparameters or data configurations.

## Acknowledgements

This project is part of our coursework for the Machine Learning class at [Your University Name]. I would like to thank our instructors for their guidance and support throughout the course.
